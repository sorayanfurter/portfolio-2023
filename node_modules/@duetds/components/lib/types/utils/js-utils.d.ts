/**
 * The fieldSorter function is a helper function that takes an array of objects and returns
 * a function that can be used to sort those objects. The returned sorting function takes two
 * parameters, which are compared using the field values in the object. If one object's field value is greater than another's, then 1 is returned; if they're equal, 0 is returned; and if one object's field value is less than another's, - 1 will be returned. This allows for easy sorting by multiple fields in any order desired (e.g., first by name ascending and then by age descending).
 *
 *
 * @param fields Sort the table
 *
 * @return A function that takes two objects and returns an integer
